# Animal-Facial-Detection-and-Classification-with-Roboflow-and-YOLOv5

In this project, I aim to develop a robust animal face detection and classification system using YOLOv5. The model is designed to identify and classify three specific animal faces : 🐱 cats - 🐶 dogs - 🐵 monkeys. 

To achieve this, I built a custom dataset 📂 comprising high-quality annotated images 🖼️, with corresponding label files 📄 specifying the class and precise facial bounding boxes. The dataset was meticulously labeled using Roboflow 🎯 to ensure accuracy and consistency.  

For model training, I leveraged transfer learning 🔄 to fine-tune the pretrained YOLOv5 model on my dataset, optimizing its ability to detect and classify animal faces with good precision. The model is capable of real-time ⏱️ inference and performs efficiently across various media formats, including static images 🖼️ - video streams 🎥 - live detection scenarios.
